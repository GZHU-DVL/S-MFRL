# S-MFRL
The source code for the paper "S-MFRL: Spiking Mean Field Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Resource Allocation of D2D Networks"

Since our next work is also based on S-MFRL, we will open source all S-MFRL algorithm codes when the next work is completed. 
(The D2D model used in this article is based on Stefan Roesch's article "Experiments in Channel Selection and Power Control for D2D Communication using Deep Reinforcement Learning", which is a great work on D2D resource allocation)
